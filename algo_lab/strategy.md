# Trading Axioms

1. **Supply and Demand zones**

- Amount of time spent in the zone previously - lesser the time spent, higher probability of same reaction - areas of consolidations vs. peaks and troughs
- Speed of approach this time - faster the approach, higher the probability of a reversal from the zone

2. **Trends**

- Persistence in price movement - being in an uptrend (can be classified in a myriad of ways) - increases the probablity of upward momentum (buying pressure on sells)

3. **Enviornment**

- VIX - high/low advancing/declining
- Economic Calendar
- Earnings Calendar
- Enviornment can predict rise in volatility/ breaking price levels (catalysts)

4. **Sensible (Magnetic, Reactive) Zones**

- Price before the previous big event heading into the next
- The low/high of the year or current trend
- The VWAP YTD, since the last big movement
- Big options strikes
- Implied options moves

5. **Volume**

- Large moves with low volumes will usually be reversed even if the original move eventually continues
- Gaps are essentially very large moves with zero volume

6. **Economic Cycles**

- FED Policy - rates rising, falling, flat?
- Inflation - rising, falling, flat?
- Manufacturing & Services PMIs - above/below 50? rising, falling, flat?
- Unemployment claims
- Secondary to price action, and never used for a long term view, these indicators can help detect overextended conditions
- Higher probability: when stock prices/ relative sector performance/ are overextended in the wrong direction - e.g. steep rallies when rates are rising

10. **Relative Asset Class Performance**

- Treasury bonds
- Corporate Bonds
- Metals
- Oil
- Real Estate
- Small, medium, and big stocks
