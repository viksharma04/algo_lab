- Amount of time spent in the zone previously - lesser the time spent, higher probability of same reaction
- Speed of approach this time - faster the approach, higher the probability of a reversal from the zone

1. **Dual Time Frame Momentum**

- Momentum indicators represent momentum trends
- Rule 1: Trade in the direction of large time frame momentum
- Rule 2: A trade execution may be made following a smaller time frame momentum reversal in the direction of the larger time frame momentum trend
